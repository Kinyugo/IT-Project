            <li>
              Design Freedom. 3D printing enables designers and manufacturers to
              create complex designs that otherwise would be cumbersome to
              create using traditional methods.
            </li>
            <li>
              Quick prototyping. Use of 3D printing especially combined with AI
              enables designers to quickly iterate through their designs in a
              shorter time span than was previously possible.
            </li>
            <li>
              Reduced waste production. 3D printing only uses the material
              needed for the process, unlike traditional methods where materials
              have to be cut into required sizes leading to production of a lot
              of waste.
            </li>
            <li>
              Improved design to production speed. 3D printing achieves what
              would take human effort days in a matter of hours reducing the
              time to production for a design. This is beneficial as it allows
              manufacturers to quickly test their products in the real world and
              make adjustments.
            </li>
            <li>
              Reduced production costs. 3D printing eliminates multiple
              manufacturing stages of the traditional manufacturing pipelines,
              this means reduced human labor cost as well as machinery and space
              cost.

            How can this technology be misused? What might be some unintended
            negative impacts? You might consider impacts on society, the
            economy, culture, etc.
          </h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg">Some cons of 3D printing are:</p>
          <ol
            class="flex flex-col list-decimal w-3/4 px-12 text-gray-700 text-md leading-8 mt-4"
          >
            <li>
              Huge initial cost. 3D printers are very expensive, thus small
              companies without huge income may be unable to meet the cost of
              buying one. This may lead to them growing at a slower rate
              compared to their bigger counterparts.
            </li>
            <li>
              Uncontrolled design freedom. While design freedom can be a good
              thing, uncontrolled design freedom may lead to substandard goods
              being produced thus endangering human lives. Also, this makes it
              easier for terrorists to manufacture their own weapons with
              unprecedented destruction ability
            </li>
            <li>
              Material limitations. Materials that can be used with 3D printing
              are limited this means that people who want to take advantage of
              3D printing are forced to use only the available materials; metal
              and plastic while traditional manufacturing methods may permit use
              of cheaper materials.
            </li>
            <li>
              Small build volumes. Most 3D printers have a small build chamber
              and thus may prevent creation of large items.
